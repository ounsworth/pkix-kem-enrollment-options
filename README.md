# PKIX KEM Enrollment Mechanisms

Options to be explored:

One-shot: 
(ie enrollment only requires one request-response exchange to the CA)
*	Server-generated private key; ex.: cert issuance returns a p12 with a private key in it.
*	Use an already-issued signing cert to sign the KEM CSR. [7]
*	Unsigned id-algNone [24]
* CRMF encrCert used in CMP [10]
 
Challenge-response Proof-of-Possession:
(ie requires at least two round-trips to the CA)

- CMPv3 [8]
  - Direct PoP
  - Inderect PoP
- CRMF CSR [9]
- CMC-over-EST [9a]
